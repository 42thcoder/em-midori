# Introduction

## What is midori?

Midori (pronounced /miːdɒliː/) is a **ruby web framework** for building APIs, web pages and realtime web services. Midori is designed to provide **non-blocking** I/O operations without **callback hells** on web development. The core library is focused on network I/Os, and gives a very easy DSL to pick up and converting existed projects on. On the other hand, midori also officially provides extension libraries that could deal with file, database, cache, network requests and other I/O operations without blocking.
